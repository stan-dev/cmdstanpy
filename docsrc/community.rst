Project templates
-----------------

Templates are a great way to piggy back on other users' work, saving you time
when you start a new project.

- `bibat <https://github.com/teddygroves/bibat>`_
  A batteries-included template for Bayesian statistical analysis projects.

- `cookiecutter-cmdstanpy-wrapper <https://github.com/WardBrian/cookiecutter-cmdstanpy-wrapper>`_
  A cookiecutter template using Stan models in Python packages, including
  the ability to pre-compile the model as part of the package distribution.

Software
--------

- `Prophet <https://github.com/facebook/prophet>`_ A procedure for forecasting
  time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit

  model checking, comparison and diagnostics.

- `BridgeStan <https://github.com/roualdes/bridgestan>`_ A project which provides efficient
  in-memory access through Python, Julia, and R to the methods of a Stan model, including
