    "# CmdStanPy Tutorial: do inference over a model conditioned on data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bayesian workflow provides a framework for model comparison and model expansion.  To facilitate this workflow, CmdStanPy provides a set of objects which manage the model, and the result of doing inference over a model conditioned on data.   The building blocks of a Bayesian data analysis are\n",
    "\n",
    " + the model, written as a Stan program\n",
    " + the data, i.e., the definitions for all data variables in the Stan program\n",
    " + the resulting inferences over the model conditioned on the data:\n",
    "     + the inference engine configuration, i.e., all arguments to the CmdStan command-line interface\n",
    "     + the inference engine outputs:  output and diagnostic files, console message, error messages, and process return codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The model\n",
    "\n",
    "The CmdStanPy class `CmdStanModel` encapsulates the model.  When working in CmdStanPy, all models must be supplied either as a Stan program file or as a compiled model executable file; or both, in which case, the base filenames must match.   While writing a program as a file requires a text editor, as opposed to the convenience of a Python notebook, in the long run, this is a more efficient way to develop complex models. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### The data\n",
    "\n",
    "Definitions of all data variables in the model are supplied either as a Python dictionary or as an on-disk data file which can be in either JSON or Rdump format.  Python dictionaries are converted to JSON inputs to CmdStanPy.  It is up to the user to save and manage the data; the data itself is not a first-class object in CmdStanPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inference Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The `CmdStanModel` provides a set of inference methods, each of which returns an inference-specific result class which encapsulates the appropriate information and operations:\n",
    "\n",
    " + `sample` - Run the HMC-NUTS sampler to produce a set of draws from the posterior distribution. Returns a `CmdStanMCMC` object which contains all draws from all sampler chains.\n",
    " + `optimize` - Produce a penalized maximum likelihood estimate (point estimate) of the model parameters.  Returns a `CmdStanMLE` object containing point estimates for all model variables.\n",
    " + `variational` - Run CmdStan’s variational inference algorithm to approximate the posterior distribution. Returns a `CmdStanVB` object containing the approximate estimates.\n",
    " + `generate_quantities` - Run CmdStan’s generate_quantities method to produce additional quantities of interest based on each draw from an existing sample. Returns a `CmdStanGQ` object which contains the draws for the generated quantities variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output files and logs\n",
    "\n",
    "The CmdStan interface is entirely file-based, therefore CmdStanPy manages the process of converting in-memory data structures to their file-based representation and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each run of an inference algorithm produces one or more output files in [Stan CSV format](https://mc-stan.org/docs/cmdstan-guide/stan-csv.html), as well as the messages written to stdout and stderr.  CmdStanPy uses per-run directories to keep all files together; the location of the directory can be specified when setting up the run, or it can be specified and/or changed afterwards via the `save_csvfiles` method, common to all inference method classes."

    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "CmdStanPy is a pure-Python3 package, but it relies on CmdStan for all\n",
    "of its functionality. There are several ways to install CmdStan and CmdStanPy, \n",
    "which depend on the kind of user you are. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conda users (Recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use `conda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/>`__, \n",
    "installation of both can be done very simply. CmdStanPy\n",
    "and CmdStan are both available via the \n",
    "`conda-forge <https://conda-forge.org/>`__ repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend creating a new environment for CmdStan[Py]:\n",
    "\n",
    ".. code-block:: bash\n",
    "\n",
    "    conda create -n cmdstan -c conda-forge cmdstanpy\n",
    "\n",
    "but installation is possible in an existing environment:\n",

    ".. code-block:: bash\n",
    "\n",
    "    conda install -c conda-forge cmdstanpy\n",
    "\n",
    "These commands will install CmdStanPy, CmdStan, and the\n",
    "required compilers for using CmdStan on your system inside\n",
    "a conda environment. To use them, run ``conda activate cmdstan``,\n",
    "or whichever name you used for your environment (following ``-n``\n",
    "above).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that CmdStan is only available on conda for versions\n",
    "2.27.0 and newer. If you require an older version, you must use\n",
    "one of the following methods to install it. If you require a\n",
    "version of CmdStan *newer* than 2.27.0, but not the latest,\n",
    "you can install it in the standard conda way by specifying\n",
    "``cmdstan==VERSION`` in the install command.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pip (non-Conda) users \n",
    "\n",
    "CmdStan can also be installed from PyPI via URL: https://pypi.org/project/cmdstanpy/ or from the\n",
    "command line using ``pip``:\n",
    "\n",
    ".. code-block:: bash\n",
    "\n",
    "    pip install --upgrade cmdstanpy\n",
    "\n",
    "The optional packages are\n",
    "\n",
    "* ``tqdm`` which allows for progress bar display during sampling\n",
    "* ``xarray``, an n-dimension labeled dataset package which can be used for outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "To install CmdStanPy with all the optional packages:\n",
    "\n",
    ".. code-block:: bash\n",
    "\n",
    "    pip install --upgrade cmdstanpy[all]\n",
    "\n",
    "To install the current develop branch from GitHub:\n",

    ".. code-block:: bash\n",
    "\n",
    "    pip install -e git+https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstanpy@/develop#egg=cmdstanpy\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you install CmdStanPy from GitHub,\n",
    "**you must install CmdStan**. The recommended way for Pip users \n",
    "to do so is via the ``install_cmdstan`` function. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Note for PyStan & RTools users:*  PyStan and CmdStanPy should be installed in \n",
    "separate environments if you are using the RTools toolchain (primarily Windows users).\n",
